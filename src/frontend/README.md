# What's this?

This is the frontend part of the Web Address Book Enhanced. In the final build, the resources
are built-in into the backend JAR and are delivered by it.

## How to use it?

### Develop

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
npx ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

### Build

To build the project run:

```bash
npx ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory.

### Run unit tests

To execute unit tests, use the following command:

```bash
npx ng test
```
